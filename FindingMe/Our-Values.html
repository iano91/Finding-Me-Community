        <h2>1. Vulnerability</h2>
        <p>
            We believe that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. At Finding Me Community, we encourage individuals to open up, share their experiences, and embrace their true emotions without fear of judgment. Vulnerability allows us to build deeper, more meaningful connections with others and helps create a space where healing can begin.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why is it Important?:</strong> Vulnerability breaks down barriers and fosters trust. When people feel safe to express themselves fully, they can begin to process their emotions and experiences, leading to personal growth and healing. In our programs, we see firsthand how embracing vulnerability helps participants form supportive bonds and work through their mental health challenges together.

                    <h2>2. Intentionality</h2>
                    <p>We approach our work with intentionality, ensuring that every action we take and every program we design serves a meaningful purpose. Our goal is to create lasting, positive impact on the mental health and well-being of the communities we work with. We are deliberate in our efforts to foster resilience, connection, and self-awareness, ensuring that our work aligns with the needs of those we serve.</p>
                    <strong>Why is it Important?:</strong> Intentionality ensures that every step we take as an organization is thoughtful and purpose-driven. This value helps us remain focused on our mission and ensures that our programs are designed to create sustainable change. By being intentional, we maximize our impact and ensure that our actions reflect our commitment to improving mental health.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>3. Service</h2>
                    <p>At the heart of our organization is service—a commitment to helping others and making a positive difference in the world. We are dedicated to serving individuals and communities by providing the mental health resources and support they need to thrive. Through our programs, events, and outreach initiatives, we strive to uplift those around us and create a culture of care and support.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
                    <p>Service reminds us that our work is about more than just ourselves. It’s about the impact we have on others and the ripple effect of that impact. By prioritizing service, we ensure that our organization remains focused on the greater good, providing mental health support that truly makes a difference in people’s lives.

                <div>
                    <h2>4. Authenticity</h2>
                    <p>Authenticity is at the core of who we are. We believe in showing up as our true selves, both as individuals and as an organization. By creating an environment where authenticity is valued, we encourage participants to be honest about their mental health journeys and embrace who they truly are. This openness helps foster trust, connection, and meaningful progress in mental health and well-being.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
                    <p>Authenticity creates a genuine connection between individuals. In a mental health context, being authentic allows people to feel seen, heard, and understood. It encourages deeper conversations and personal growth. At Finding Me Community, authenticity is what drives our peer-to-peer model and helps participants feel safe in expressing themselves openly.
